# 4-20ma-load
Constant current load for testing 4-20mA interfaces.
PCB designed using KiCad.
This circuit is based around the Texas Instruments XTR 117 4-20ma current loop transmitter chip.
User selectable current values will allow currents of 4, 8, 12, 16 & 20mA to be selected.
Using a precision 2.5V Reference IC (REF3125) along with 0.1% tolerance resistor chains to generate Iin will result in very accurate current values.
